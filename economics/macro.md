# Macro Economics

- there are two schools of economics:

  1. **Micro Economics** (الاقتصاد الجزئي): the study of individual actors make decision of allocation of _scarce_ resources.
  2. **Macro Economics** (الاقتصاد الكلي): the study of economics in aggregate

- actors: could be firms, people, households etc...
- in economics we make assumption to simplify complex behavior of humans, in order to make some sort of science/math to predict something in the future.
- while studying economics you might think it is like physics or math. It is not it all depends on the assumption you made to come up with the formulas you are using.

## Scarcity (الندرة)

- it is the main reason there is economic science in the first place.
- **Economics**: is the science of how to manage scarce resources.

## Normative and Positive Statements

- **Normative Statement (بيان معياري)**: It is a statement that is judged based on someones's morals and ethics
- **Positive Statement (بيان ايجابي)**: It is a statement that can be tested.

examples:

- Normative Statement:

we can make surveys and see for some people where welfare program exists and another area where it doesn't, and we compare the results.

| Normative statements                                                                 | Positive statements                                                            |

| Paying people who are not working, even though they could work, is wrong and unfair. | Raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for government programs grows the economy. |
| government should raise the taxes on the wealthy people                              | Programs like welfare reduce the incentive for people to work.                 |

## Economy Types

who gets what? what do we produce? who gets the production?

**Command Economy or Planned Economy (الاقتصاد المخطط مركزيا)**: the government(not necessary but usualy) controls the production of goods and decides who consume it.
**Market Economy (اقتصاد السوق)**: market decides what to produce and who gets it (based on money)

## Opportunity cost and the Production Possibilities Curve

- **Ceteris(other things) paribus(equal)**: we assume every thing else is equal and the only affecting factors are the factors under study.
