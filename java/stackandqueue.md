# Stack and Queue

* `Deque<Integer> stack = new LinkedList<>();`
* `Deque<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();`
* the stack methods are -> push, pop, peek and they all throw exceptions if somethin wrong happened
* the queue methods are -> add, remove, element and they all throw exceptions if somthing wrong happened
* there are equavelant methods for both stack and queue which return null/false instead of throwing exceptions
* there is Stack interface but its based on vector which is deprecated and it is recommended to use the deque interface
