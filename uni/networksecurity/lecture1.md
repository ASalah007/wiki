# DES

## Stream Cipher

* plain text is divided into small packets (bit/bits)
* small blocks simplify the cryptanalysis (3, 4, 8)
* must be very fast

* the smaller the block is the simpler the analysis and it become faster
* could be used in network applications


## Block Cipher

* plain text is divided into large blocks (64, 128, 256, ...bits)
* large blocks complicate the cryptanalysis

* more dominant as the computer becomes faster and faster


## Reversible Cipher 

* when you have block size of n bits:
  * you can have 2**n possible blocks
  * and <mark>2**n!</mark> Possible transformations
