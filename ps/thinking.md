# Thinking Techniques


# Thinking incrementally 

Incremental algorithms process input step by step, in each step it finds its way to update the old state with the new input 
for example **insertions sort**

# Problem Domain re-interpretation

Sometimes problems could be re-interpreted into different domains (Graphically, Mathematically, Geometrically)
